# Portfolio Pivot: From Data Science Consulting to Product Development

**Date:** December 2024  
**Context:** Pivoting from data science/AI consulting to mobile app development and web design due to market challenges.

---

## 🎯 New Target Industry/Role

### Primary Positioning: **Full-Stack Product Developer / Indie Developer**

**Target Roles:**
- Full-Stack Developer (Web + Mobile)
- Product Developer / Indie Developer
- Mobile App Developer
- Web Designer/Developer
- Software Engineer (Generalist)
- Startup/tech companies building products
- Agencies needing web + mobile capabilities

**Why This Fits:**
- ✅ You ship products (Maris, web apps)
- ✅ Full-stack capability: Web (React/TypeScript) + Mobile (React Native)
- ✅ Product-focused, not just consulting
- ✅ Much broader market than data science consulting

---

## 📋 Portfolio Redefinition Recommendations

### 1. Hero Section - Reframe from Consulting to Product Building

**Current:**
- Badge: "Available for Web & AI Projects"
- Headline: "Building Intelligent Data, AI, and Web Apps"
- Subheadline: "I build production-ready web apps, AI agents, and data platforms"

**Suggested:**
- Badge: "Product Developer & Full-Stack Engineer"
- Headline: "Building Mobile Apps, Web Experiences, and Digital Products"
- Subheadline: "I design and develop mobile apps, modern websites, and full-stack applications"

**Rationale:** Shift from consulting services to product creation.

---

### 2. Featured Project - Highlight Maris Instead of Economic KPI Pulse

**Why:**
- ✅ Shows mobile app capability (iOS + Android)
- ✅ Demonstrates product ownership (not just consulting)
- ✅ More relevant to new direction
- ✅ Shows you can ship to app stores

**Current Featured:** Economic KPI Pulse (web dashboard)  
**New Featured:** Maris (mobile app)

---

### 3. "What I Do" Section - Replace AI/Data with Mobile Apps

**Current Pillars:**
1. Web Apps
2. AI / Agents
3. Data Platforms

**Suggested Pillars:**
1. **Mobile Apps** (iOS & Android) - Link to `/work?tab=apps`
2. **Web Development** (React, TypeScript, modern design) - Link to `/work?tab=web`
3. **Full-Stack Solutions** (end-to-end product development) - Link to `/work`

**Rationale:** Mobile apps should be first, web second, full-stack third. De-emphasize AI/Data.

---

### 4. Reorder Portfolio Tabs - Prioritize Product Work

**Current Order:**
1. Predictive Modeling & ML
2. Data Analysis / Operations
3. Business Intelligence / Dashboards
4. NLP & Text Analytics
5. Web Development
6. Applications
7. Research

**Suggested Order:**
1. **Applications** (mobile apps - Maris) ⭐ **FIRST**
2. **Web Development** (web apps)
3. **Data Science / AI** (keep but de-emphasize)
4. **Research** (keep)

**Rationale:** Lead with product work (mobile + web), data science becomes secondary.

---

### 5. Update Services Section - Focus on Product Development

**Current:** "Faster Time-to-Value", "Measurable Impact", etc. (consulting-focused)

**Suggested:**
- **End-to-End Product Development** - "From concept to App Store, I handle design, development, and deployment"
- **Mobile-First Design & Development** - "Native iOS and Android apps with modern UI/UX"
- **Modern Web Experiences** - "Responsive, performant websites built with React and TypeScript"
- **From Concept to Launch** - "Full product lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, iterate"

**Rationale:** Shift from consulting deliverables to product outcomes.

---

### 6. Update Testimonials - If Possible, Include Product/App Feedback

**Current:** Enterprise consulting testimonials (VP of Operations, CTO, Analytics Director)

**Better:** User feedback, app reviews, or product-focused testimonials

**If No Product Testimonials Yet:**
- Remove or de-emphasize testimonials section
- Or reframe as "What Clients Say" with focus on product delivery

---

### 7. Update About Page - Emphasize Product Building Journey

**Add:**
- Story of pivoting from consulting to product development
- Experience building and launching Maris
- Passion for creating user-facing products
- Full-stack capabilities (web + mobile)

**Current:** Heavy emphasis on data science credentials  
**New:** Balance between technical skills and product-building experience

---

### 8. Update Stats - Include Product Metrics

**Current:**
- "10+ Years Experience"
- "50+ Projects"
- "25+ Certifications"
- "8+ Industries"

**Add/Replace:**
- "Apps in App Store" (1+)
- "Websites Launched" (X+)
- "Products Shipped" (X+)
- "Full-Stack Projects" (X+)

**Rationale:** Show product outcomes, not just consulting metrics.
